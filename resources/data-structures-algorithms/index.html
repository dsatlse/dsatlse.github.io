  	<p>Many times in interviews for a data science/ tech role, you will have to answer programming (data structures and algorithms) questions. The reason is that algorithms/data structures commonly occur in programming, and they test the ability to <em>think computationally</em> and solve problems using programming - knowledge of data science/stats/maths is good but in addition you need to be able to <em>program</em>.</p>

268. Missing Number (Easy)
+ https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/ 
+ O(n) time, My solution used the difference between (n + 1)(n) / 2
+ There's probably a way to it using bitsets (From Solution, yes and that is to use XOR, which is a self-inverse.)

190. Reverse Bits (Easy)
+ https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/
+ O(1) time, simple, reverse the bits
+ Very elegant solution in the solutions: using bitmasks and magic number-of-1-bits

+ Traverse the array from the right to left, and see if there is a path from the origin 0
+ O(n) time;

91. Decode Ways
+ https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/
