During weekly meetings we would then discuss our reflections on the chapter, things we found hard or interesting, go through the solutions for exercises and review relevant blogposts to a level of detail dependent on time constraints.\nIt would be also great to try and connect what we learn here to our university curriculum, especially MA211 and MA203.\nBelow you'll find a long list of links, loosely partitioned into vague categories.

A Flask frontend is used (which also computes validation scores), which sends the results to a Go backend, which does further validation before updating a centralised Firebase database used as persistence (for the blockchain).\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/kaggle-clone/","title":"Kaggle Clone"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/search-smartly/":{"body":"NLP side:  Tasked to extract information from a property's text description. \n\nSome labels (pre-existing data in their dataset) provided; Baseline performance for simple binary categories (e.g. propertyHasGarden, propertyHasPool) ~90% using Bag-Of-Words + Logistic Regression \nFormer approach not as successful on more complex queries (e.g. NumberOfFloors, NumberOfBathrooms) &amp; also no labels provided for some of the information. This necessitated exploring more complex language models, using preexisting implementations in Spacy for Named Entity Recognition (e.g. for Train Stations) and Parts-Of-Speech tagging to generate rules \nAlso looked into Bi-Directional Representation Transformers (BERT) for Question-Answering\n\nComputer Vision side: Tasked to extract information from a property's images.\n\nWrote several scripts to extract heuristic from property images, e.g. colour, brightness\nLooked into existing APIs for object detection (e.g. AWS Rekognition) on unlabelled images. Settled with using CVLib's implementation of YOLOV3\n\nRecommender System: Build a model to target users with more relevant properties\n\nUse of unsupervised methods, Principal Components Analysis + K-Means Clustering to identify implicit groups of users\nAfter event data provided (user clicks and their associated properties), implemented a simple model to predict user clicks at different stages of the onboarding process using Gradient Boosted Trees (CatBoost) with ~70% ROC AUC Score for 3 events (e.g. property clicked, image clicked, )\nUsed SHAPley values, LIME, and CatBoost in-built feature importance (each future's contribution to loss reduction) to explore what features (thus preferences) important to users.\n\nAll methods were then bundled as a simple Flask API server.\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/search-smartly/","title":"SearchSmartly feature extraction"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2020/":{"body":"","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2020/","title":"Projects in 2020-2021"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/search/":{"body":"","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/search/","title":"Search"}},"docInfo":{"https://dsatlse.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://dsatlse.github.io/about/":{"body":67,"title":0},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/agm/":{"body":17,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/ai-governance/":{"body":19,"title":5},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/blackrock/":{"body":16,"title":1},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/bloomberg/":{"body":14,"title":4},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/kpmg/":{"body":16,"title":4},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/quantco/":{"body":20,"title":5},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/rezatec/":{"body":22,"title":6},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/taster-session/":{"body":15,"title":5},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/aspect-capital/":{"body":21,"title":4},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/collectiwise/":{"body":7,"title":4},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/ey/":{"body":29,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/give-it-a-go/":{"body":13,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/hedge-funds/":{"body":18,"title":4},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/hudson-thames/":{"body":27,"title":5},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/neural-networks/":{"body":7,"title":4},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/quantco/":{"body":20,"title":5},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2019/tobit-modelling/":{"body":12,"title":5},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2020/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/materials/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://dsatlse.github.io/materials/deep-learning/":{"body":354,"title":2},"https://dsatlse.github.io/materials/haskell/":{"body":413,"title":1},"https://dsatlse.github.io/materials/lse-modules/":{"body":501,"title":2},"https://dsatlse.github.io/materials/ucl-modules/":{"body":233,"title":2},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2018/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2018/imp/":{"body":229,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/dsi/":{"body":101,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/imp/":{"body":92,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/kaggle-clone/":{"body":115,"title":2},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2019/search-smartly/":{"body":183,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/projects/2020/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://dsatlse.github.io/search/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":37},"lang":"English"};
