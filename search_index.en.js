Us\nSet up in 2017, the LSESU Machine Learning Society focused on increasing the LSE community’s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider data science skills. In 2020, we have rebranded to the LSESU Data Science Society.\nWith the increased availability of large data sets and the importance of predicting outcomes rather than just explaining them in the social sciences, machine learning is starting to become a popular tool. However, both the theory and application of these methods remain detached from the research and teaching we are exposed to. We want to address the broadening interface between ML and social sciences by empowering students with the right tools to be able to understand and deploy ML methods to solve their data-driven questions.\nOur mission is to\n\nIntroduce the scope and potential of data science and its applications to students of all backgrounds\nEquip members with foundational skills and provide opportunities to apply data science skills to solve problems in a range of contexts, including but not limited to the Social Sciences, Economics, and Finance\nEngage and build ties with the wider LSE community, including societies and academic departments\nProvide LSE students with opportunities to engage with data science practitioners in industry and enhance their exposure to real-world use cases of  data science\n\nWe aim to build a sustainable, inclusive and supportive community through\n\nImpactful industry speaker and community events\nOpportunities to lead or collaborate on meaningful projects with technical rigour\nEngaging workshops on data analytics, machine learning and programming\nPlatform for members to network, share resources and help one another\n\nContact Us\nYou can reach us if you have any queries or proposals via the following\n\nFacebook\nSignup\nEmail\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nGitHub\nZulip\nTwitter\n\nCommittee of 2020\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPresident\n\t\t    \t Chris Chia\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVice President\n\t\t    \t Zhen-Yen Chan\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSecretary\n\t\t    \t Rafay Butt \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTreasurer\n\t\t    \t Eldric Lem \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Marketing\n\t\t    \t Hajni Ngyugen \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Marketing\n\t\t    \t Rachel Soh \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Head of Engineering\n\t\t    \t Konstanty Kowalewski\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Education\n\t\t    \t Maja Lie  \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Partnerships\n\t\t    \t Pearl Yuan\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Projects\n\t\t    \t Mun Fai Chan\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/about/","title":"About"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/":{"body":"You can find a list of our past events below\n\n2018 events\n2019 events\n2020 events\n\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/","title":"Events"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/":{"body":"","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/","title":"Events in 2018-2019"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/agm/":{"body":"ML at LSE Annual General Meeting &amp; Elections\n \nFinal event of the year.

During weekly meetings we would then discuss our reflections on the chapter, things we found hard or interesting, go through the solutions for exercises and review relevant blogposts to a level of detail dependent on time constraints.\nIt would be also great to try and connect what we learn here to our university curriculum, especially MA211 and MA203.\nBelow you'll find a long list of links, loosely partitioned into vague categories.

informative\nTimetable, you have to create your own timetable, not updated ofc\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMathematical Methods 2\n\nMA100 and MT of MA212 except\nTriple integrals\nLine integrals\nScalar potential\nIndependence of path\nGreen's Theorem\n\n\nComputational Methods 2\n\nInto to numerical stability\nLU, SVD decomposition\nInterpolation of functions\nNumerical integration\n\n\nAnalysis 4\n\nMostly overlaps with MA203 except\nWeierstrass Approximation Theorem\nArzela-Ascoli Theorem\nContraction Mapping Theorem\nPicard-Lindelof Theorem (relation to ODEs)\nPoint-set topology bits and pieces\n\n\nAlgebra 3\n\nThis is basically LT of MA212\nHas a bit more theory on linear forms\n\n\nAlgebra 4\n\nMostly overlaps with MA211 except\nAutomorphism groups\nSemi-direct product, group actions\nFinite multiplicative subgroup of a field is cyclic\nField extensions in more detail\n\n\n\nModules\n\nFunctional Analysis, LT, requires Analysis 4\nAlgebraic Topology, LT, requires Algebra 3, cancelled for 2020/21\nCommutative Algebra, LT, requires Algebra 4\nDifferential Geometry, LT, requires Mathematical Methods 2\nNumerical Methods, MT, requires Mathematical Methods 2 and Computational Methods 2\nGalois Theory, MT, requires Algebra 4\nLie Groups and Lie Algebras, MT, requires Algebra 3\nMeasure Theory, MT, requires Analysis 4\n\nMiscellaneous\nHere are some bits from my original email to Irini (she said that it's absolutely okay with her and only worries about the timetable clashes).\nThis one is about Functional Analysis\n\nAs far as I understand, methods of functional analysis are heavily used in theoretical machine learning (such as this). This sentiment is also reinforced whenever I talk with academics in this field.\n\nThis one about Algebraic Topology\n\nI find the Topological Data Analysis and related ideas very interesting and I would very much like to have a head start to pursue this more in graduate school. The introduction to https://math.hawaii.edu/~yury/papers/probpers.pdf was very informative to me, it seems that persistance homology really is a valid basis for statistical theory. I've also found introduction and conclusion to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02034.pdf very interesting.\n\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/resources/ucl-modules/","title":"UCL
