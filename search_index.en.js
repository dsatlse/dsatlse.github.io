During weekly meetings we would then discuss our reflections on the chapter, things we found hard or interesting, go through the solutions for exercises and review relevant blogposts to a level of detail dependent on time constraints.\nIt would be also great to try and connect what we learn here to our university curriculum, especially MA211 and MA203.\nBelow you'll find a long list of links, loosely partitioned into vague categories.

However moral hazard and informational asymmetry prevents this exchange - for example, any actor could misreport the performance of their model. The proposed solution is to use a new blockchain mechanism: predictions are fed into an ensemble model , hence the ensemble validation score against some preagreed valiation set is the (\"Proof of Ensemble Training\"). The reward mechanism to each actor on the network, would be some preagreed measure of feature importance in the ensemble model (thus the contribution of each actor).\nFor this prototype, a decentralisated network is not implemented.
