competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider data science skills. In 2020, we have rebranded to the LSESU Data Science Society.\nWith the increased availability of large data sets and the importance of predicting outcomes rather than just explaining them in the social sciences, machine learning is starting to become a popular tool. However, both the theory and application of these methods remain detached from the research and teaching we are exposed to. We want to address the broadening interface between ML and social sciences by empowering students with the right tools to be able to understand and deploy ML methods to solve their data-driven questions.\nOur mission is to\n\nIntroduce the scope and potential of data science and its applications to students of all backgrounds\nEquip members with foundational skills and provide opportunities to apply data science skills to solve problems in a range of contexts, including but not limited to the Social Sciences, Economics, and Finance\nEngage and build ties with the wider LSE community, including societies and academic departments\nProvide LSE students with opportunities to engage with data science practitioners in industry and enhance their exposure to real-world use cases of  data science\n\nWe aim to build a sustainable, inclusive and supportive community through\n\nImpactful industry speaker and community events\nOpportunities to lead or collaborate on meaningful projects with technical rigour\nEngaging workshops on data analytics, machine learning and programming\nPlatform for members to network, share resources and help one another\n\nContact Us\nYou can reach us if you have any queries or proposals via the following\n\n\n    \n    LSESU\n\n\n\n    \n    Email\n\n\n\n    \n    Facebook\n\n\n\n    \n    Instagram\n\n\n\n    \n    LinkedIn\n\n\n\n    \n    Github\n\n\n\n    \n    Zulip\n\n\n\nCommittee of 2020\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPresident\n\t\t    \t Chris Chia\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVice President\n\t\t    \t Zhen-Yen Chan\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSecretary\n\t\t    \t Rafay Butt \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Marketing\n\t\t    \t Hajni Nguyen \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Marketing\n\t\t    \t Rachel Soh \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Head of Engineering\n\t\t    \t Konstanty Kowalewski\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Education\n\t\t    \t Maja Lie  \n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Partnerships\n\t\t    \t Pearl Yuan\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHead of Projects\n\t\t    \t Mun Fai Chan\n\t\t  \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/about/","title":"About"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/":{"body":"You can find a list of our past events below\n\n2018 events\n2019 events\n2020 events\n\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/","title":"Events"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/":{"body":"","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/","title":"Events in 2018-2019"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2018/agm/":{"body":"ML at LSE Annual General Meeting &amp; Elections\n \nFinal event of the year.

Data Science is not just about machine learning models.\n\n\nMaja: Soft skills - interacting with stakeholders, getting the right data from the people are critically important.\n\n\nJeria: It's not just about hypothesis testing and modelling - summarising statistics, data viusalisations - is important,  data needs to be communicated professionally to the public\n\n\nDerek: Learning how to collaborate on teams on a more technical internship vs just working on own\n\n\nTechnical Skills &amp; Application Process\n\n\nAaron: Coding tests - Leetcode, Object Oriented Programming.  CV, Online Tests (Situational Judgement Test). 3rd stage was programming test.\n\n\nDerek: General application, psychometric tests (numerical ,logical), video interviews. Assessment Centre\n\n\nJeria: Cultural fit, interview with statisticians. Python (numpy, pandas), R, Excel (VLOOKUP, Macros helpful) are helfpul to know.\n\n\nMaja: Numerical reasoning test (stats, logic, interpreting graphs), face-to-face interview\n\n\nMun Fai : General application. Choose one of Python &amp; R. Internship involved looking at niche packages (100s of users on Github) - so being able to read  documentation and source code - to understand how these niche packages work is useful.\n\n\nWian: Know one language - recommends Python - as it ahs libraries for statistical models, but also  teaches general software engineering. Also strive for a good mathematical / statistical background.\n\n\nTop Tip\n\n\nAaron: Don't be afraid to apply! The tech industry isn't as scary as you might think! Be sure to ask others for help!\n\n\nDerek: Apply as early as you can; the later you apply the more people you compete with.  Make sure to have your skills clearly shown in your CV! (Initially rejected by Bank of England but called again due to DS experience on CV)\n\n\nJeria: Be open minded about the industries you consider - e.g. governmental departments. There are tech opportunities everywhere!\n\n\nMaja: Be willing to learn and well rounded and dynamic! Read the News! Also Women please apply! It's not just a men's field. Dont be afraid to apply - just go for it!\n\n\nMun Fai: Take as many maths, stats, econometrics courses as you can - especially if you want to break into data science - vs a CS student your programming skills would not be as strong, but you can excel in understanding the mathematical side.\n\n\nWian: Specialise in a particular area -  Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Time Series. Be creative, don't just fit a model. Do more than what is expected.\n\n\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2020/internship-panel/","title":"LSESU Data Science Society: Tech Internship Panel"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2020/modelling-covid-19-transmission/":{"body":"Modelling COVID-19 Transmission in Grocery Stores with G-Research\n \nFacebook Event Link: https://www.facebook.com/events/364282395016305/\nIn this talk, Dr Fabian Ying, Quantitative Researcher at G-Research, will be presenting a COVID-19 project that modelled virus transmission and customer movement in supermarkets, using agent-based models, flow-based human mobility models, and anonymised customer mobility data\nSlides available here\n","id":"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2020/modelling-covid-19-transmission/","title":"Modelling COVID-19 Transmission in Grocery Stores with G-Research"},"https://dsatlse.github.io/events/2020/predicting-us-election/":{"body":"LSESU Data Science Society Workshop: Classification for US Election prediction\n \nFacebook Event Link: https://www.facebook.com/events/809096953197924/\nWe will cover how classification methods: Logistic Regression and Random Forests - can be used to model the US election.

The reason is that many companies do not offer data science roles / internships for undergraduates - but the Software Engineering or \"Technology\" route could serve as an indirect avenue to doing data science, and in addition they can develop your programming and problem solving skills (which are very useful).\nIn addition, you may be interested in data science and technology - but not be extremely into the technical / programming aspects - for that, \"technology\" encompasses many other roles, such as business analyst, product manager and so on.\nRoles in Data Science:\nData Scientist\nMachine Learning Engineer \nData Engineer - Involved in building sytems - https://github.com/datastacktv/data-engineer-roadmap\nBut many other roles utilise data science - academics, traders, consultants.\n1st years\nSpring Weeks\nMany banks and several other companies offer \"Spring Weeks\" and other \"Insight programmes\" in Technology, a 1 week insight into how technology is being used and what a technology role in the company would involve. An advantage of applying to a Spring Week, is that some of them will convert successful participants to the summer internship for your 2nd year. A non-exhaustive list (might not be updated / accurate):\n\nBanks: Bank of America, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Nomura, Macquarie, RBC, RBS\nAsset Managers: Blackrock, Schroders, Point72\nTrading: Flow Traders, Optiver, Citadel\nAdvisory / Concultancy: EY, KPMG, Deloitte, PWC, McKinsey\nTech: Bloomberg\n\nInternships\nThere are not that many internships at big companies available for first year internships - they want to be able to have you on as a graduate the year following the internship -  you may need to find smaller companies, or network. A non-exhaustive list:\n\nMetaswitch Networks\nBank of England first year internship\nGoogle Summer of Code (GSoC)\nGoogle STEP\n\n2nd years\nInternships\nLook for a \"Data Science\" internship in your second year, or otherwise a \"Software Engineering\" / technology internship. Since many LSE students are interested in banking and finance (and you are also interested in technology), a technology role in a bank may be the way to go - LSE students may have an advantage in that in addition to knowing some programming and data science (because of the society), students have direct knowledge of finance but also the social sciences, which could offer an unique perspective.\n3rd years\nInternships\nThis depends on if you want to pursue a masters, if so then apply to the internships again. Otherwise look for graduate opportunities.\nMasters\nLook for a Data Science / Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence masters. These will likely require a strong mathematical foundation (Multivarite Calculus / Linear Algebra / Statistics - MA212, ST202).

There are also many aspects of programming /technology / software engineering that do not require lots of maths - software engineering (frontend - making web apps, backend - ), UI/UX (User Interfaces, User Experiences on an app / website/ product), and roles that might not require programming - Product Manager, Business Analyst.\nDon't be dissuaded if you are a social sciences student - there are many people who have went on to pursue careers in technology.\nIf you want to understand the underlying data science theory beyond a conceptual level (i.e. \"this is how it works\"):\nmathematical foundations: A background in Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus (in MA100, MA212) and  Statistics (ST100, ST202) is helpful\nprogramming: Familarity with one programming language (Python/R) will be very helpful.

During weekly meetings we would then discuss our reflections on the chapter, things we found hard or interesting, go through the solutions for exercises and review relevant blogposts to a level of detail dependent on time constraints.\nIt would be also great to try and connect what we learn here to our university curriculum, especially MA211 and MA203.\nBelow you'll find a long list of links, loosely partitioned into vague categories.
