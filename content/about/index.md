Set up in 2017, the LSESU Machine Learning Society focused on increasing the LSE communityâ€™s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider data science skills. In 2020, we have rebranded to the LSESU Data Science Society.

With the increased availability of large data sets and the importance of predicting outcomes rather than just explaining them in the social sciences, machine learning is starting to become a popular tool. However, both the theory and application of these methods remain detached from the research and teaching we are exposed to. We want to address the broadening interface between ML and social sciences by empowering students with the right tools to be able to understand and deploy ML methods to solve their data-driven questions.

Our mission is to
- Introduce the scope and potential of data science and its applications to students of all backgrounds
- Equip members with foundational skills and provide opportunities to apply data science skills to solve problems in a range of contexts, including but not limited to the Social Sciences, Economics, and Finance
- Engage and build ties with the wider LSE community, including societies and academic departments
- Provide LSE students with opportunities to engage with data science practitioners in industry and enhance their exposure to real-world use cases of  data science

We aim to build a sustainable, inclusive and supportive community through
- Impactful industry speaker and community events
- Opportunities to lead or collaborate on meaningful projects with technical rigour
- Engaging workshops on data analytics, machine learning and programming
- Platform for members to network, share resources and help one another

We invite you to join us on Zulip, which provides a convenient way to communicate in asynchronous and structured way. We want it to become a tight-knit community, where you can ask any questions you might have, or just talk about anything. We will also be posting careers opportunities and events on the `#opportunities` stream. Turn on your email notifications to stay updated about new relevant messages!
