Set up in 2017, the LSESU Machine Learning Society focused on increasing the LSE communityâ€™s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider data science skills. In 2020, we have rebranded to the LSESU Data Science Society.

With the increased availability of large data sets and the importance of predicting outcomes rather than just explaining them in the social sciences, machine learning is starting to become a popular tool. However, both the theory and application of these methods remain detached from the research and teaching we are exposed to. We want to address the broadening interface between ML and social sciences by empowering students with the right tools to be able to understand and deploy ML methods to solve their data-driven questions.
