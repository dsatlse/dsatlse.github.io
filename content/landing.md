Set up in 2017, the LSESU Machine Learning Society focused on increasing the LSE community’s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider data science skills. In 2020, we have rebranded to the LSESU Data Science Society.

Our aim is to **build a data science community at LSE**. We want to increase the LSE community’s understanding of and skill in machine learning and data science, and their applications to a wide range of fields and interests.
