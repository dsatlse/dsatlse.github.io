We are also inviting more experienced applicants to be project managers - the leaders of the data science projects:

To apply, fill in the application to be a project developer (the above link), send in an email to data-science@lsesu.org and include the following :

+ Why you want to be a Project Manager
+  Any past leadership experience and how you intend to lead your team of developers
+  A preliminary project brief similar to those found on [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zGzELuMGVVPcCYQYfrgawX0syhp0B1VJ?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zGzELuMGVVPcCYQYfrgawX0syhp0B1VJ?usp=sharing)

We would require all applications for Project Managers to be in by **Sunday, 26 September 2020**.
Due to the tight timeline, preliminary project briefs need not be substantive as those shared in the above folder.

Ideally, we are looking for the following people :

+ Someone who has prior experience with machine learning and is willing to lead a project catered to beginners/ novices (2 projects) OR
+  Someone who has intermediate expertise in machine learning and programming (preferably postgraduates) and is willing to lead a technically more advanced project (1 project)
