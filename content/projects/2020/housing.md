# Rental Property Modelling

The team for this project explored the use of machine learning (linear regression, random forests) to model housing prices (and determinants) using rental property data from *Zoopla* They also utilised *sentiment analysis*, a branch of Natural Language Processing techniques that involves determining whether text is *positive* or *negative*, to analyse property reviews and produced a heatmap of property sentiment.
