# Data Science Incubator - Computer Vision & Finance

## Finance

The team for this project implemented a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast the Ethereum exchange rate (ETHEUR)

## Computer Vision

The Computer Vision team independently researched and learnt about more about deep learning techniques:
1. Computer Vision, the InceptionV3 model with ImageNet weights for feature extraction
2. The *Attention* mechanism to identify the relevant portion of the image to caption
3. RNNs / Language Models for the generation of the caption.

The end goal was to produce a simple flask server that would take in an image and generate a caption.
