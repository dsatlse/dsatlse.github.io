Many times in interviews for a data science/ tech role, you will have to answer programming (data structures and algorithms) questions. The reason is that algorithms/data structures commonly occur in programming, and they test the ability to *think computationally* and solve problems using programming - knowledge of data science/stats/maths is good but in addition you need to be able to *program*.

# Theory
