The following section is a collection of resources about learning **specific programming languages** or **programming-related topics**.

the frequently mentioned ""relevant"" programming languages to learn for data science (due to the number of in-built libraries and supporting ecosystem they have, and their learning curve) are: 

+ Python: [python](python)
+ R: [R](r)
+ Julia: [julia](julia)

However, in addition languages for software engineering (or data engineering) are equally if not more important - how to build software systems to store, retrieve, in an efficient manner. This includes

+ SQL: [SQL](sql)
+ Haskell : [Haskell](haskell)


And finally, learning some **web development** (frontend and backend) can be useful for presenting your results / models, or are just useful skills to have.

+ Web Development : [Web Development](web-development)
