The following section is a collection of resources about learning **specific programming languages** or **programming-related topics**.

Some frequently mentioned ""relevant"" programming languages to learn for data science (due to the number of in-built libraries and supporting ecosystem they have, and their learning curve) are: 

+ Python: [python](/resources/python)
+ R: [R](/resources/r)
+ Julia: [julia](/resources/julia)


However, in addition languages for software engineering (or data engineering) are equally if not more important - how to build software systems to store, retrieve, in an efficient manner. This includes

+ SQL: [SQL](/resources/sql)
+ Haskell : [Haskell](/resources/haskell)
