The following section is a collection of resources about learning **specific programming languages** or **programming-related topics**.

Some frequently mentioned ""relevant"" programming languages to learn for data science (due to the number of in-built libraries and supporting ecosystem they have, and their learning curve) are: 

+ Python: [python](/resources/python)
+ R: [R](/resources/r)
+ Julia: [julia](/resources/julia)


However, in addition languages for software engineering (or data engineering) are equally if not more important - how to build software systems to store, retrieve, in an efficient manner. This includes

+ SQL: [SQL](/resources/sql)
+ Haskell : [Haskell](/resources/haskell)
+ Javascript : [javascript](/resources/javascript)
+ Java : [java](/resources/java)


In addition to learning programming languages, learning how to use tools - IDEs , git, and software engineering practices.

+ Missing Semester of CS Education - covers how to use Git, text editors for programming - [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

+ MIT 6.031: Software Construction - covers software engineering principles (in Java) but still very relevant - [http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa19/](http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa19/)
