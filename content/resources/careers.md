The following section is a collection of resources about applying to, or **careers in Data Science** and more broadly, **careers in technology**.

# Careers in Data Science and Technology for LSE Students

There are numerous careers in Data Science and Technology / Software Engineering-  it depends broadly on your (career) interests. 

Despite being the **Data Science** society, why include Software Engineering / Technology?  The reason is that many companies do not offer data science roles / internships for undergraduates - but the Software Engineering or "Technology" route could serve as an indirect avenue to doing data science, and in addition they can develop your programming and problem solving skills (which are very useful).

In addition, you may be interested in data science and technology - but not be extremely into the technical / programming aspects - for that, "technology" encompasses many other roles, such as business analyst, product manager and so on.

### 1st years

#### Spring Weeks
Many banks and several other companies offer "Spring Weeks" and other "Insight programmes" in Technology, a 1 week insight into how technology is being used and what a technology role in the company would involve. An advantage of applying to a Spring Week, is that some of them will convert successful participants to the summer internship for your 2nd year. A non-exhaustive list:

#### Internships

There are not that many internships at big companies available for first year internships - they want to be able to have you on as a graduate the year following the internship -  you may need to find smaller companies, or network. A non-exhaustive list:

+ Metaswitch Networks


### 2nd years

#### Internships

Look for a "Data Science" internship in your second year, or otherwise a "Software Engineering" / technology internship. Since many LSE students are interested in banking and finance (and you are also interested in technology), a technology role in a bank may be the way to go - LSE students may have an advantage in that in addition to knowing some programming and data science (because of the society), students have direct knowledge of finance but also the social sciences, which could offer an unique perspective.

### 3rd years

#### Internships

This depends on if you want to pursue a masters, if so then apply to the internships again. Otherwise look for graduate opportunities.

### Masters

Look for a Data Science / Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence masters. These will likely require a strong mathematical foundation (Multivarite Calculus / Linear Algebra / Statistics - MA212, ST202).  There are also Computer Science conversion masters for students who studied different subjects in undergrad (including Econ, social sciences).

## What courses should I select?

It depends on how much you  enjoy the theoretical aspects and mathematics. There are also many aspects of programming /technology / software engineering that do not require lots of maths - software engineering (frontend - making web apps, backend - ), UI/UX (User Interfaces, User Experiences on an app / website/ product), and roles that might not require programming - Product Manager, Business Analyst.

Don't be dissuaded if you are a social sciences student - there are many people who have went on to pursue careers in technology.


If you want to understand the underlying data science theory beyond a conceptual level (i.e. "this is how it works"):

**mathematical foundations**: A background in Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus (in MA100, MA212) and  Statistics (ST100, ST202) is helpful
**programming**: Familarity with one programming language (Python/R) will be very helpful. The LSE Digital Skills Lab offers instruction in Python/R, and there is a new half unit course in 2020: [ST101 - Programming for Data Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST101.htm)

Regression is a really important topic and powerful tool, LSE has an unique advantage in that it has a world-leading economics department - and good courses on Econometrics - statistical methods in Economics to understand causal effects.

Regression (Statistics) :  

+ [ST211 - Applied Regression (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST211.htm) - regression in R, more applied
+ [ST300 - Regression and Generalised Linear Models  (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST300.htm) - the theory of regression and generalised linear models, an extension of linear regression.


Econometrics : 

+ [EC220 - Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/EC/2020_EC221.htm), introduction to Econometric theory using calculus
+ [EC221 - Principles of Econometrics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/EC/2020_EC221.htm), introduction to Econometric theory using Linear Algebra (essentially a graduate level course)
+ [EC309 - Econometric Theory](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/EC/2020_EC309.htm) - deeper dive into econometric theory
+ [EC333 - Problems of Applied Econometrics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/EC/2020_EC333.htm) - a look at the applications of econometrics to real world examples


If you are interested in more advanced statistical courses:

+ [ST304 - Time Series and Forecasting (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST304.htm) - how to model a variable over time
+ [ST308 - Bayesian Inference (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST308.htm) - statistical inference from the Bayesian perspective (as opposed to frequentist of ST202)
+ [ST310 - Machine Learning (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST310.htm)


If you are interested in more 'project'	 based courses:

+ [ST309 - Elementary Data Analytics (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST309.htm) 
+ [MA334 Dissertation in Mathematics (Half Unit)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/MA/2020_MA334.htm)

There are also more domain-specific courses, such as:

+ [FM320 Quantitaitve Finance](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/FM/2020_FM320.htm) - the MT content is about risk management, and covers time series modelling for risk (EWMA, GARCH, DCC)
+ [ST326 - Financial Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST326.htm) - covers a range of topics in statstics that are relevant to finance - portfolio optimisation, risk modelling, machine learning

Other Courses:

+ MA314 - Algorithms and Programming,  MA320 - Mathematics of Networks
