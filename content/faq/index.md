### What does the LSESU Data Science society do?
<!-- Check out our GIAG booklet here:  -->

We organise [events, workshops](/events), [projects](/projects) and [community platforms](https://dsatlse.zulipchat.com/) to introduce students to the applications of data science in different fields and industries, and build a community for LSE students to learn, accelerate and support each other on their data science journeys. We’re also planning our first flagship event in early November where we’ll have a weekend of panels, workshops and challenges to help students level up in data science, gain project experience and grow their network!

### How much time commitment does being a member involve?
For this term, our events and workshops take place on Zoom every Wednesday for one hour each - workshops at 11am-12pm UKT and events at either 1-2pm or 2-3pm UKT, but these are completely optional. If you’re selected to be part of one of our project teams, you’ll be expected to work on the project for 2-5 hours a week depending on the project. Subcommittee members are expected to commit 5 hours a week to complete tasks, attend meetings and facilitate events and workshops.

### What do I get out of buying the membership?
You’ll get to be part of our community - members get exclusive access to our Zulip workspace, where we share data science resources and opportunities every week, and where members can discuss data science topics, join round tables (co-working sessions) and form teams to do projects and hackathons together. We also have member-only socials once a term, and our flagship event will be member-restricted. You also have to be a member to apply to join our project teams and subcommittees. 

### How much does your membership cost?
£3.50. You can buy our membership on the SU website here: [https://www.lsesu.com/communities/societies/group/machinelearning/](https://www.lsesu.com/communities/societies/group/machinelearning/)

We’ll be giving an introduction to data science and some cool applications, and talking about different career opportunities and how to get started in learning data science. You’ll also get to meet our committee and find out more about our different subcommittees if you’re interested in getting involved with organising our activities!
