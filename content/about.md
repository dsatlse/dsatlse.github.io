LSESU Data Science Society (formerly LSESU Machine Learning Society) is a society at
the London School of Economics and Political Science. This is the {{ committee() }} committee.

This is an outline of the technical stack for the LSESU Data Science Society. Here's a bunch of principles. In one word we want to focus on __continuity__.
 - Requiring minimal IT competence to maintain
 - Clear documentation of the tools and how they relate to each other
 - Liberal enough to extend without reinventing the wheel
 - Easy transfer of ownership to subsequent committees
 - Ideally keep the core pieces stable on unpaid plans
 - Plug-and-play nature of components: if something is not used, don't force it
