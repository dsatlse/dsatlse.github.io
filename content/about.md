## About

Set up in 2017, the LSESU Machine Learning Society focused on increasing the LSE communityâ€™s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider Data Science skills, renaming ourselves the LSESU Data Science Society


As large datasets ("Big Data") continue to become increasingly available,  the ability to analyse data to derive insights and theories is becoming incredibly important.  Because of this, Data Science, the application of statistical and computational (using programming) techniques to conduct analysis on data from different domains -  not limited to the social sciences, economics, and finance -  is becoming increasingly valuable.   However, for many LSE students, both the theory and applications of Data Science may seem out of reach, given that in addition to learning about your domain of expertise, it may also require venturing into the territory of programming (computer science), mathematics and statistics.  The LSESU Data Science society aims at exposing LSE students to how Data Science can be applied to different fields, empower students to have the right tools (through both theory and application) to be able to pursue questions and analysis in a data driven way, and to build a genuine interest in Data Science and a community at LSE.


**Our Mission**:

- Introduce the scope and potential of data science and its applications to students of all backgrounds.
- Equip members with foundational skills and provide opportunities to apply data science skills to solve problems in a range of contexts, including but not limited to the Social Sciences, Economics, and Finance
- Engage and build ties with the wider LSE community, including societies and academic departments.

**We aim to build a sustainable, inclusive and supportive community experience through**:

- Impactful industry speaker and community events
- Opportunities to lead or collaborate on meaningful projects with technical rigour
- Engaging workshops on data analytics, machine learning and programming
- Platform for members to network, share resources and help one another

**We invite you** to join us on Zulip, which provides a convenient way to communicate in asynchronous and structured way - Zulip allows you to mix informal and formal discussion, but also keep track of key topics (similar to Slack - but *open source*).  We want it to become a tight-knit community, where you can ask any questions you might have, or just talk about anything! We will also be posting  careers opportunities/events on the `#opportunities` stream. (turn on your email notifications to stay updated about new messages)

You can read up on  how to use streams and topics on Zulip as well as [Zulip reading strategies](https://zulipchat.com/help/reading-strategies). As a rule of thumb, if you have a question, insight or comment not directly related to a previous message, start a new topic. Otherwise, just respond to the old one.
