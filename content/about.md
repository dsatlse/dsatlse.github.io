# About

Set up in 2017, the _LSESU Data Science Society_ (formerly _LSESU Machine Learning Society_) is a student society at the London School of Economics and Political Science. This is the {{ committee() }} committee. We aim to increase the LSE communityâ€™s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies.

With the increased availability of large data sets and the importance of predicting outcomes rather than just explaining them in the social sciences, machine learning is starting to become a popular tool. However, both the theory and application of these methods remain detached from the research and teaching we are exposed to. We want to address the broadening interface between ML and social sciences by empowering students with the right tools to be able to understand and deploy ML methods to solve their data-driven questions. We we will focus on the following.

- Introduce the scope and potential of data science and its applications to students of all backgrounds
- Equip members with foundational data science skills and provide opportunities to apply these skills to solve problems in a range of contexts, including but not limited to the Social Sciences and Finance
- Provide LSE students with opportunities to engage with data science practitioners in industry and enhance their exposure to real-world use cases of data science
- Engage and collaborate with the wider LSE community, including societies and academic departments

This is a static website made with Zola and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/dsatlse/dsatlse.github.io). All public materials developed by the society will be available on it, along with documentation of projects, events and public Zulip communication. Here are some core principles related to our technical stack.

 - Requiring minimal IT competence to maintain
 - Clear documentation of the tools and how they relate to each other
 - Liberal enough to extend without reinventing the wheel
 - Easy transfer of ownership to subsequent committees
 - Ideally keep the core pieces stable on unpaid plans
 - Plug-and-play nature of components: if something is not used, don't force it

We also have a [Zulip organization](https://dsatlse.zulipchat.com) and we invite you to join us there! If you've never used Zulip before, we recommend reading up on streams and topics as well as [Zulip reading strategies](https://zulipchat.com/help/reading-strategies). As a rule of thumb, if you have a question, insight or comment not directly related to a previous message, start a new topic. Otherwise, just respond to the old one. This way, Zulip allows for sensibly structured asynchronous communication. Also, considering our community is really rather quite small, it might be a nice idea to enable email notifications on new messages in relevant streams (such as `#opportunities`) so you don't miss anything!
