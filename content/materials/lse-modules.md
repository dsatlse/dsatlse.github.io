Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of courses at the LSE that are relevant to Data Science. It includes courses that are:

+ **pre-requisite knowledge**: for example Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus (in MA100, MA212), Statistics (ST100, ST202); they could provide the background for study of more advanced topics
+ **more 'advanced topics'**: for example, Machine Learning (ST310) and Time Series Forecasting (ST304),
+ **relevant domain-specific (economics, finance, social science) courses**, such as: Principles of Econometrics (MA212) and Risk Management and Modelling (FM321); courses that also have a overlap
