## About Us

Set up in 2017, the LSESU Machine Learning Society focused on increasing the LSE community’s understanding of machine learning, its potential applications and equip members with relevant competencies. Since then, we have expanded to consider not only machine learning, but wider data science skills. In 2020, we have rebranded to the LSESU Data Science Society.

With the increased availability of large data sets and the importance of predicting outcomes rather than just explaining them in the social sciences, machine learning is starting to become a popular tool. However, both the theory and application of these methods remain detached from the research and teaching we are exposed to. We want to address the broadening interface between ML and social sciences by empowering students with the right tools to be able to understand and deploy ML methods to solve their data-driven questions.

Our mission is to
- Introduce the scope and potential of data science and its applications to students of all backgrounds
- Equip members with foundational skills and provide opportunities to apply data science skills to solve problems in a range of contexts, including but not limited to the Social Sciences, Economics, and Finance
- Engage and build ties with the wider LSE community, including societies and academic departments
- Provide LSE students with opportunities to engage with data science practitioners in industry and enhance their exposure to real-world use cases of  data science

We aim to build a sustainable, inclusive and supportive community through
- Impactful industry speaker and community events
- Opportunities to lead or collaborate on meaningful projects with technical rigour
- Engaging workshops on data analytics, machine learning and programming
- Platform for members to network, share resources and help one another

**Zulip**, an online chat platform (for members) will serve as our online community. It allows for communication in a structured manner using *streams* - we will be sharing careers opportunities and events on the `#opportunities` stream.  You can ask any questions you might have about data science, or just talk about anything on the `#helpdesk` and `#random` streams.

## FAQ

### What does the LSESU Data Science society do?
<!-- Check out our GIAG booklet here:  -->

We organise [events, workshops](/events), [projects](/projects) and [community platforms](https://dsatlse.zulipchat.com/) to introduce students to the applications of data science in different fields and industries, and build a community for LSE students to learn, accelerate and support each other on their data science journeys. We’re also planning our first flagship event in early November where we’ll have a weekend of panels, workshops and challenges to help students level up in data science, gain project experience and grow their network!

### How much time commitment does being a member involve?
For this term, our events and workshops take place on Zoom every Wednesday for one hour each - workshops at 11am-12pm UKT and events at either 1-2pm or 2-3pm UKT, but these are completely optional. If you’re selected to be part of one of our project teams, you’ll be expected to work on the project for 2-5 hours a week depending on the project. Subcommittee members are expected to commit 5 hours a week to complete tasks, attend meetings and facilitate events and workshops.

### What do I get out of buying the membership?
You’ll get to be part of our community - members get exclusive access to our Zulip workspace, where we share data science resources and opportunities every week, and where members can discuss data science topics, join round tables (co-working sessions) and form teams to do projects and hackathons together. We also have member-only socials once a term, and our flagship event will be member-restricted. You also have to be a member to apply to join our project teams and subcommittees. 

### How much does your membership cost?
£3.50. You can buy our membership on the SU website here: [https://www.lsesu.com/communities/societies/group/machinelearning/](https://www.lsesu.com/communities/societies/group/machinelearning/)


### How can I receive updates from your society?
Like and follow our social media pages:
Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/dsatlse](https://www.facebook.com/dsatlse) | Instagram: [@dsatlse](https://www.instagram.com/dsatlse/)

After buying our membership, you will receive a weekly newsletter to your LSE email. In this you will find the link to join our Zulip workspace, and also feel free to join our members-only Facebook group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/664688501064249](https://www.facebook.com/groups/664688501064249)

### How can I get involved? 
Buy our membership and sign up for our Give-it-a-go session next Wednesday! 
[https://forms.gle/21VTxnGJM9EvNdyi7](https://forms.gle/21VTxnGJM9EvNdyi7)

We’ll be giving an introduction to data science and some cool applications, and talking about different career opportunities and how to get started in learning data science. You’ll also get to meet our committee and find out more about our different subcommittees if you’re interested in getting involved with organising our activities!
