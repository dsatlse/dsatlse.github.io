This section is a collection of resources about the **mathematical foundations** that might be helpful for data science.  In particular, if you want to understand the underlying *theory* of Machine Learning/Deep Learning methods, in addition to having familiarity with at least one programming language (or basic computer science),  it would definitely be helpful to have some familiarity with the following topics:

+ (Multivariate) Calculus
+ Linear Algebra
+ Probability and Statistical Theory

And the following topics might be helpful to know as well:
+ (Convex) Optimisation
+ Analysis
