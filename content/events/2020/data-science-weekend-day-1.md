> Are you an enthusiastic junior who would like to explore the field of Data Science? Or are you a more intermediate learner looking to upskill and try your first datathon? Or maybe you'd just like to learn something new and meet like-minded people?

> LSESU Data Science Society is proud to announce its first flagship event: “Data Science Weekend - Navigating a Data-Centric World”.
Supported by the new LSE Data Science Institute, this 2-day event will include panel discussions by data scientists from the finance and consulting industries, beginner-friendly workshops and a 24-hour data science challenge open to all skill-levels.
