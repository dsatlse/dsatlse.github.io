We will introduce **computer vision** - how computers can "see" using Deep Neural Networks, and transfer learning - how neural networks can transfer knowledge from one domain to another problem.

This will be helpful for students of all backgrounds - Computer Vision allows you to quantify visual data (images, video) and has many applications towards social sciences and finance. The workshop also makes use of Tensorflow, a common framework for Deep Learning.

We will keep it high level/conceptual, exploring the intuition, as opposed to a deep dive into the mathematics. Code is provided, which will illustrate the concepts (a deep understanding of programming not needed).
