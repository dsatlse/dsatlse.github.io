Collaboration with the LSESU Women in Business Society

> The Women in Tech Panel, as part of women empowerment week, features incredible women in data science from prominent firms such as Amazon, Bain & Google Stadia. The discussion includes their reflections about their careers path and choices, overcoming gender issues in a largely male-dominated industry & their advice for students looking to pursue a career in the data-science industry. Discussion will be followed by an interactive Q&A session.
