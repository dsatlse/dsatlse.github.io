A collaboration with the LSESU Actuarial Science Society, we will explore the distinction between careers in statistics - being an actuary vs a data scientist in this speaker event. 

In this event, we have invited a data scientist and an actuary to give insight into their field of work and discuss the skills necessary to succeed as a data scientist and an actuary. There will be a panel discussion and a question and answer session so please do come prepared with questions that you may have!
