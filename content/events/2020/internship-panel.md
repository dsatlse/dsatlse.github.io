#### Recap:

##### Biggest takeaway / Skills gained from internships

+ **Wian**: From "Lanterne", how to build full end-to-end software - migrating/deploying to AWS.

+ **Mun Fai**: Internship at Singapore Department of Statistics had research focus as opposed to modelling - machine learning. Data Science is not just about machine learning models.

+ **Maja**: Soft skills - interacting with stakeholders, getting the right data from the people are critically important.

+ **Jeria**: It's not just about hypothesis testing and modelling - summarising statistics, data viusalisations - is important,  data needs to be communicated professionally to the public

+ **Derek**: Learning how to collaborate on teams on a more technical internship vs just working on own

#### Technical Skills & Application Process

+ **Aaron**: Coding tests - Leetcode, Object Oriented Programming.  CV, Online Tests (Situational Judgement Test). 3rd stage was programming test.

+ **Derek**: General application, psychometric tests (numerical ,logical), video interviews. Assessment Centre

+ **Jeria**: Cultural fit, interview with statisticians. Python (numpy, pandas), R, Excel (VLOOKUP, Macros helpful) are helfpul to know.

+ **Maja**: Numerical reasoning test (stats, logic, interpreting graphs), face-to-face interview

+ **Mun Fai** : General application. Choose one of Python & R. Internship involved looking at niche packages (100s of users on Github) - so being able to read  documentation and source code - to understand how these niche packages work is useful.


+ **Wian**: Know one language - recommends Python - as it ahs libraries for statistical models, but also  teaches general software engineering. Also strive for a good mathematical / statistical background.

#### Top Tip
+ **Aaron**: Don't be afraid to apply and ask others for advice

+ **Derek**: Apply as early as you can; the later you apply the more people you compete with. Make your skills stand up on your CV.

+ **Jeria**: Be open minded about the industries you consider - e.g. governmental departments

+ **Maja**: Be willing to learn. Dont be afraid to apply - just go for it!

+ **Mun Fai**: Take as many maths, stats, econometrics courses as you can - especially if you want to break into data science - vs a CS student your programming skills would not be as strong

+ **Wian**: Specialise in a particular area -  NLP, CV, time series. Be creative, don't just fit a model. Do more than what is expected.
