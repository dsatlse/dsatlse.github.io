Thanks to :  LSE Department of Statistics' Dr Yunxiao Chen

"This summer, GCSE and A-level exams were cancelled. The government created a rather controversial algorithm to award grades to students as around 40% of results were lower than the grades predicted by their teachers.
In this speaker event, Dr Chen (Assistant Professor, LSE) will introduce statistical methods for grade prediction based on the educational testing system in the United States.* The talk will be divided into 3 sections: how to input missing data, what statistical framework to use and how to ensure fairness."
