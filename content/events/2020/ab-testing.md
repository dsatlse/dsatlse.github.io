> Evan Chow is an experienced data scientist (MSc EME â€˜21) who has worked in data science at various Silicon Valley companies including Snap and Uber. At Snap, he joined their first data team to drive forward A/B experimentation, causal inference, and data analytics at scale. Before that, he worked on driver-rider matching algorithms and rider pricing at pre-IPO Uber. Evan is a Princeton graduate and a (soon-to-be) published member of ACM SIGIR.
