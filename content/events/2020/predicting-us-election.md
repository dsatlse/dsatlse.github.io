We will cover how classification methods: *Logistic Regression* and *Random Forests* - can be used to model the US election. Classification means predicting a binary outcome e.g. Democrat/Republican vote.

Though we use elections (political science) as an example, classification can be applied to a variety of problems: finance, healthcare, and beyond

We will keep it high/conceptual level, exploring the intuition, as opposed to a deep dive into the mathematics. Code is provided, which will illustrate the concepts (a deep understanding of programming not needed).
