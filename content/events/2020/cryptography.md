> Interested in cryptography but don't know where to start? This workshop offers a very short, simplified introduction to cryptography. We will cover two very simple ciphers before discussing symmetric and asymmetric cryptography conceptually. At the end, we will briefly touch on the future of cryptography and look forward to what's to come.

> Why is cryptography useful in data science? A recent topic that ties together data science with cryptography is *Federated Learning* - which is concerned about how we can apply machine learning on data in a privacy preserving way. In addition, a good understanding of cryptography would also help in developing secure web applications (to deploy your machine learning solutions or data science analysis), or in understanding blockchain.
